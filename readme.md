## Questions
### Describe how Kotlin handles null safety. What are nullable types and non-null types in Kotlin? (0,5 points)

Null safety is a core feature of Kotlin that minimizes null pointer exceptions by defaulting to non-null values and explicitly
marking types as nullable or non-null. Nullable types, denoted with ?, can hold null values, while non-null types, declared
without ?, cannot.(Which can bee seen in the example blow)


```kotlin 
// example code snippet
val a: String = "value" // non-null type
val b: String? = null // nullable type
```

### What are lambda expressions and higher order functions in Kotlin? Why would you store a function inside a variable? (0,5 points)

Labmdafunction:


Lambda functions in Kotlin are functions that can be kept in variables.
They act like objects, making them easy to reuse and pass around. They help write flexible code,
making programs easier to understand and modify.

```kotlin
//example for lambda functions
val sum = { x: Int, y: Int -> x + y }
```

Higher order functions:

Higher-order functions in Kotlin can take other functions as input or return functions. They offer flexibility in programming.
```kotlin
//example for higher order function
fun operation(x: Int, y: Int, action: (Int, Int) -> Int): Int {
    return action(x, y)
}
```

### Provide a solution for the following number guessing game inside `App.kt`. (3 points)

## Number Guessing Game in Kotlin
The game is a simple number guessing game. The task is to generate a random, max 9-digit, number. The number must **not contain repeating digits**. Valid digits are 1-9.
Ask the user to guess the max 9-digit number. The game is finished when the user guesses the correct digits in the correct order.
In each round, the user gets feedback about the number of correct digits and the number of correct digits in the correct position.
The output should be in the format "n:m", where "n" is the number of digits guessed correctly regardless of their position,
and "m" is the number of digits guessed correctly at their correct position. Here are some examples:

This example shows the game flow with 4-digits to guess (the default argument)

Generated number: 8576
-	User input: 1234, Output: 0:0
-	User input: 5678, Output: 4:1
-	User input: 5555, Output: 1:1
-	User input: 3586, Output: 3:2
-	User input: 8576, Output: 4:4 -> user wins

Take a look into the provided code structure in `src/main/kotlin/App.kt`. Implement the following methods (lambda expressions):
- _playNumberGame(digitsToGuess: Int = 4)_ (1 point): The main game loop that handles user input and game state. Make use of _generateRandomNonRepeatingNumber_ and _checkUserInputAgainstGeneratedNumber_ here. This function also utilizes a default argument
- _generateRandomNonRepeatingNumber_ (1 point): A lambda expression that generates a random number with non-repeating digits of a specified length.
- _checkUserInputAgainstGeneratedNumber_ (1 point): A lambda expression that compares the user's input against the generated number and provides feedback.

``CompareResult.kt`` This class is a data structure which helps with bundling the result of the comparison of the user input and the generated number. Look at the toSting() and use it in your output.

Run the project with `./gradlew run` and test your implementation with the provided tests in `src/test/kotlin/AppTest.kt` with `./gradlew test`.

# Project Structure
The project is structured into two main Kotlin files:

**App.kt**: Contains the main game logic and functions.

**AppTest.kt**: Contains unit tests for the various functions in App.kt.
